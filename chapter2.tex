\chapter{Laser Interferometers for Gravitational-wave Detection}

We show in this chapter how a laser interferometer can detect
gravitational wave strain, and we present the basic design principles
of the LIGO detectors. We motivate the desire for higher laser power,
and introduce some of the details of the interferometer that are
relevant for later chapters. To reduce clutter, I do not specify the
polarization of the gravitational wave strain and use simply $h$ for
its symbol.


\section{Measuring Gravitational-wave Strain with Light}
Considering a simple Michelson interferometer consisting of a laser, a
beam splitter, and two end mirrors each a distance $L$ from the beam
splitter, one can understand intuitively why an interferometer can
detect gravitational waves. If an appropriately polarized
gravitational wave is present, it will stretch one arm and compress
the other. For two wave packets leaving the beam splitter at the same
time, each heading down a different arm, the roundtrip travel time for
the light traveling down the stretched arm is longer than that for the
light traveling down the compressed arm. For the stretched arm the
roundtrip travel time is:
\begin{equation}
t_{\mathrm{stretched}} = \frac{2 L}{c} \left( 1 + \frac{h}{2} \right),
\label{eq:trt+} 
\end{equation}
and for the compressed arm the roundtrip travel time is:
\begin{equation}
t_{\mathrm{compressed}} = \frac{2 L}{c} \left( 1 - \frac{h}{2} \right).
\label{eq:trt-} 
\end{equation}
A stationary clock at the beam splitter could, in principle, measure
the non-zero difference in arrival times, $\Delta t = 2Lh/c$, of the
two different wave packets.\footnote{It should be noted that $h$ is
  treated as a constant in Eqs. \ref{eq:trt+} and \ref{eq:trt-}. We
  use the approximation that the gravitational wave wavelength
  $\lambda_{gw}$ is much larger than the Michelson arm length
  $L$. This means that the temporal variation of $h(t)$ is negligible
  during the time it takes the photon to make its roundtrip.}

However, in practice, instead of individual wave packets, we send a
continuous electromagnetic wave into the interferometer. The
difference in travel times turns into a difference in phase:
\begin{equation}
\Delta \phi_{\mathrm{MICH}} = \omega \Delta t = \frac{2 L}{c} \omega h,
\label{eq:deltaphi}
\end{equation}
where $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the laser light. We now
introduce the modified Michelson interferometer used in LIGO, and in
this context continue the discussion of strain measurement and
sensitivity.

\section{Power-recycled Fabry-Perot Michelson Interferometers} 
The LIGO detector configuration is a power-recycled Fabry-Perot
Michelson laser interferometer as depicted in
Fig.~\ref{fig:IFOschematic}. A beam splitter (BS) directs 1064~nm
light from a diode-pumped, power amplified, and intensity and
frequency stabilized Nd:YAG laser to the Fabry-Perot arms, which are
made of an input test mass mirror (ITM) and an end test mass mirror
(ETM). Both arms are of length $L$ and are set to maintain nearly
perfectly destructive interference of the recombined light at the
anti-symmetric (AS) port, where a photodetector is placed to measure
any change in power. A power recycling mirror (RM) at the symmetric
port directs the constructively-interfered light back into the
interferometer.

\begin{figure}

  interferometer.}
\label{fig:IFOschematic}
\end{centering}
\end{figure}

The Fabry-Perot arms are a modification to the Michelson that
increases the change in phase measured at the AS port compared to that
for a simple Michelson. Rather than make a single roundtrip down each
arm, the light is trapped by the Fabry-Perot cavity, experiencing many
roundtrips before returning to the beam splitter and interfering with
the light from the other arm. The effect is that Eq.~\ref{eq:deltaphi}
for the Fabry-Perot Michelson includes a frequency-dependent phase
gain factor, $\phi_g(f)$:
\begin{equation}
\Delta \phi = \frac{2 L}{c} \omega \phi_g(f) h.
\label{eq:deltaphi}
\end{equation}
For Enhanced LIGO, $\phi_g = 137$ at DC and falls off after 85~Hz due
to the cavity pole.

\subsection{DC readout}
The gravitational wave readout in Enhanced LIGO did not operate
precisely at the dark fringe at the AS port. Instead, it used a small
offset from the quadratic minimum so that any change in phase is
linear with power as is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:DCreadout}. The
offset used was $\phi_0 \approx 6 \times 10^{-5}$~rad. (cite tobin's
thesis.)

With a DC offset, the electric field at the AS port was $E_{AS} =
E_{BS}\sin{(\phi_0 + \Delta\phi)}$. Squaring the electric field and
expanding about $\phi_0$, we determine the power recorded by the
photodetector, $P_{AS}$:
\begin{align}
P_{AS} &= P_{BS} \sin^2{(\phi_0 + \Delta\phi)} \\
% &\approx P_{BS}\sin^2{(\phi_0)} + 2P_{BS}\sin{(\phi_0)}\cos{(\phi_0)}\Delta\phi
 &\approx P_{BS}\sin^2{(\phi_0)} + 2P_{BS}\phi_0\Delta\phi
\end{align}
The first term on the right hand side of the expanded $P_{AS}$ is the
DC power due to the static offset from the fringe. The second term on
the right hand side describes how a change in phase at the AS port is
converted to a change in power. Called the \emph{optical gain}, this
relationship is linear and proportional to the power at the beam
splitter. Written explicitly to highlight all of its dependencies, the
optical gain is:
\begin{equation}
\frac{4 L}{c} P_{BS} \phi_0 \omega \phi_g(f) h.
\label{eq:opticalgain}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics{figures/DCreadout.pdf}
\caption[The DC readout dark fringe]{The DC readout dark fringe. The
  AS port is not kept at the dark fringe, but is slightly offset by
  $\phi_0$. Changes in AS port phase due to gravitational wave strain
  are a linear function of power.}
\label{fig:DCreadout}
\end{centering}
\end{figure}



\subsection{DARM}
An essential term in LIGO is DARM, the differential arm length. This
is the length degree of freedom affected by gravitational waves. It is
defined as
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{DARM} := L_- := L_x - L_y
\end{equation}
where $L_x$ and $L_y$ are the lengths of the $x$-arm and $y$-arm,
respectively. When there is no gravitational wave, $L_-=0$, but in the
presence of a gravitational wave, the DARM signal is:
\begin{equation}
L_- = Lh
\end{equation}
We see that $L$ is the conversion factor between GW strain and DARM.





\section{Signal Versus Noise} 
As we see from Eq.~\ref{eq:opticalgain}, there are three fundamental
ways to increase the optical gain and therefore produce more power at
the AS port for a given GW strain. The three ways are to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item make the arms longer \vspace{-10 pt}
\item increase the power at the BS \vspace{-10 pt}
\item increase the phase gain of the Fabry-Perot arms
\end{enumerate}
We always win by making the arms longer, but it must be noted that the
latter two points are only valid where the interferometer is sensing
noise limited. \textcolor{blue}{finish this discussion!}

The factors that must be considered in the design of any detector can
be grouped into two categories: signal and noise. The ability to make
a claim of detection is largely dependent on the magnitude of the
signal to noise ratio (SNR). 

No matter how large a signal one might have, it won't be found
confidently, or at all, if there is too much noise. The noise itself
is best grouped into categories of displacement noise, which affects
the length of the arms, and sensing noise, which affects the
measurement of the signal. In the next sections I briefly describe the
specific types of displacement and sensing noises affecting the
sensitivity of laser interferometers.
%A summary of the noise budget is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:NB}.

\subsection{Displacement Noise} 
The primary displacement noises that plague laser interferometers are
ground motion and thermal noise. Ground motion physically displaces
the mirrors, resulting in changes in the lengths of the
arms. Interferometer sensitivities are typically limited by seismic noise below
70~Hz. Thermal noise takes the form of Brownian motion. The atoms of
the mirror move around such that their rms motion effectively
displaces the mirror's surface. Current GW interferometers are not
limited by thermal noise, but future generations plan to be. 



\subsection{Sensing Noise}
The primary sensing noise is shot noise. It limits the sensitivity of
GW interferometers above 200~Hz.

% \section{DC readout / more laser power}
% Increasing the laser power in the interferometer is a 

% Shot noise is a Poissonian process: the average number of photons
% striking a detector, $\left<x\right>$, is equal to the variance of the
% mean number of photons, $\left<x^2\right> - \left<x\right>^2$, from a
% given chunk of time $\tau$ to another. For large $\left<x\right>$, the
% distribution becomes Gaussian, but the mean and variance are still
% equivalent. Based on this property and Parseval's theorem, the power
% on a detector due to shot noise is:
% \begin{equation}
% P_{SN} = \frac{\left<x\right>}{\tau} h \nu = \sqrt{2 P_{DC} h \nu}
% \end{equation}
% where $P_{DC}$ is the DC power on the photodiode, $h = 6.626 \times
% 10^{-34}$ Js is Planck's constant, and $\nu = 2.82 \times 10^{14}$ Hz
% is the frequency of the incident light. The units of shot noise are
% W/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$.

% The sensitivity of DC readout to gravitational wave strain is
% dependent not only on the optical gain, but on the noise at
% detector. The shot-noise-limited sensitivity is the shot noise divided
% by the optical gain:

\section{Controlling the Interferometer}
The ability of the interferometer to provide a differential arm length
signal depends on the many interferometer cavities being locked
\textcolor{blue}{(define locking!)} all at once. It is the light,
after all, that serves as our probe of arm length. The motion of the
mirrors without any control is too large for a locked state to
naturally occur. The rms pendular displacement of the mirrors without
control is 1 \micron, equivalent to a full laser wavelength. The arm
length would swing from one free spectral range (FSR) to the next,
never staying put long enough at any particular FSR.

The motion of the interferometer mirrors must be controlled enough so
that resonance is achieved and error signals fall in a linear
regime. Since the strain sensitivity is determined by mathematically
undoing the (carefully measured) effect of the control system on DARM,
control does not directly improve the strain sensitivity. The purpose
length control does serves is to make the strain measurement
possible. For other degrees of freedom, such as angular motion, only
the controlled residual matters ..
Control, however, introduces noise so there is a fine
balance that must be found between too much and too little control.

Design considerations for the control loops include how much motion at
what frequencies can be tolerated, and the signal to noise ratio of
the motion sensor.


\subsection{RF Sidebands}
Phase modulation multiplies carrier light with field
$E_0e^{i\omega t}$ by $e^{i \Gamma \sin{(\Omega t)}}$, where $\Gamma$
is the modulation index and $\Omega$ is the frequency of the phase
modulation. Using the Jacobi-Anger expression,
\begin{equation}
e^{i z \sin{\theta}} = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} J_n(z) e^{i n \theta},
\end{equation}
where $J_n$ are the Bessel functions, we can write the first few terms
(n = 0, 1, -1) of the phase-modulated field:
\begin{equation}
E_{modulated} = E_0 J_0(\Gamma) e^{i\omega t} + E_0 J_1(\Gamma)
e^{i(\omega + \Omega) t} + E_0 J_{-1}(\Gamma)
e^{i(\omega - \Omega) t} + ...
\end{equation}
We see that both an upper and lower primary sideband are created, with
frequencies $\omega + \Omega$ and $\omega - \Omega$. Phase modulation
does produce an infinite number of sidebands, yet the amplitude of the
Bessel function decays rapidly with higher $|n|$, so only this first
set of sidebands are significant.




\subsection{Digital Control in LIGO}
Although the interferometer is an analog instrument, it is interfaced
through a digital control system. The analog sensor signals are sent
through an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), digitally filtered, and
then sent through a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) before returning
to the interferometer's actuators as control signals. The use of a digital
control system means complex filters can be more easily implemented
than they would with analog electronics, and the potential 

There a select few control systems that remain completely analog, like
the laser intensity stabilization servo (ISS). When the frequencies of
interest extend beyond several tens of thousands of Hz, the use of
computers becomes impractical.




\subsection{Mirror Suspension and Actuation}
\label{sec:suspension}
The primary interferometer optics are suspended in vacuum so that they
act like free masses at the frequencies in the GW detection band. Each
mirror is hung from a single \textcolor{blue}{xx m diameter} wire that
loops around the bottom of the barrel of the mirror as shown in
Fig. \ref{fig:suspension}. Stand-offs glued just above the mirror's
center of mass on both sides of the barrel mark the final point of
contact of the wire with the mirror, and both ends of the wire are
clamped to the top of a suspension cage.

Each mirror is equipped with four optical sensor and electro-magnetic
(OSEM) actuators for providing control to the mirror. Magnets arranged
to form the four corners of a square are glued on the mirror's back
surface, and the OSEM units envelop them. Length control of the
cavities, for instance, sends current of the same magnitude through
each coil on a given mirror to provide a piston force for changing the
mirror's position.

Minimal contact with the mirrors is necessary to avoid thermal
noise. Therefore, the suspensions provide minimal damping to the
mirrors. Damping for the large optics is instead achieved
electronically through the use of optical levers. They provide
velocity damping only (no DC control) between 0.2~Hz and 2~Hz. The
open loop transfer function of the optical lever servo is in the
Appendix (Figure~\ref{fig:oplevOLG}).

The suspensions are AC damped at all times for each of the large
optics through optical lever witnesses. Keeping the mirrors quiet
enough with respect to their local ground is necessary to allow for
the initial locking of the interferometer, so each suspended optic,
small and large, is quieted by its OSEM signals during the initial
locking stages. After the interferometer is locked, the angular OSEM
feedback is turned off, and the position OSEM feedback remains.
