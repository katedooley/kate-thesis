and Control (ASC) subsystem as implemented for the sixth science run 
of the LIGO interferometers. A statically unstable radiation 
pressure torque induced opto-mechanical mode limited the operation 
of the Initial LIGO interferometers to 7\~{}W input power. We designed 
and implemented an improved ASC control scheme for Enhanced LIGO, an 
incremental upgrade to the Initial LIGO interferometers, designed to 
run with 30\~{}W input power. Through a change of basis, the new ASC 
design directly addresses the statically unstable mode, allowing for 
interferometer operation at powers greater than 7\~{}W and good noise 
performance. Highlights of the ASC performance include: successful 
suppression of unstable modes, limited impact on in-band strain 
sensitivity, and rms mirror motions of \$\le 1\times 10^{-7}\$ 
rad. The demonstrated success of the Enhanced LIGO ASC model and 
design provides confidence in the ASC design for Advanced LIGO.},

More specifically, we compare the results of a detailed numerical model with the behavior of the recycling cavity of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) detector located in Livingston, Louisiana. In the interferometer's normal mode of operation, the recycling cavity is stabilized by inducing a thermal lens in the cavity mirrors with an external CO2 laser. During our study, this thermal compensation system was not operating, causing the cavity to be marginally optically unstable and cavity modes to become degenerate. In contrast to stable optical cavities, the modal content of the resonating beam in the uncompensated recycling cavity is significantly altered by very small cavity length changes. This modifies the error signals used to control the cavity length in such a way that the zero crossing point is no longer the point of maximum power in the cavity, nor is it the point where the input-beam mode in the cavity is maximized.}},

in Advanced LIGO, the planned upgrade to LIGO, the US laser
interferometric gravitational wave observatory, we are developing three
sub-systems: a hydraulic external pre-isolator for low frequency
alignment and control, a two-stage active isolation platform designed to
give a factor of \~{}1000 attenuation at 10 Hz, and a multiple pendulum
suspension system that provides passive isolation above a few hertz. The
hydraulic stage uses laminar-flow quiet hydraulic actuators with
millimeter range, and provides isolation and alignment for the optics
payload below 10 Hz, including correction for measured Earth tides and
the microseism. This stage supports the in-vacuum two-stage active
isolation platform, which reduces vibration using force feedback from
inertial sensor signals in six degrees of freedom. The platform provides
a quiet, controlled structure to mount the suspension system. This
latter system has been developed from the triple pendulum suspension
used in GEO 600, the German/UK gravitational wave detector. To meet the
more stringent noise levels required in Advanced LIGO, the baseline
design for the most sensitive optics calls for a quadruple pendulum,
whose final stage consists of a 40 kg sapphire mirror suspended on fused
silica ribbons to reduce suspension thermal noise.}},

The changes are particularly significant in the crystal thermal lensing (refraction index and thermal expansion) and in its Verdet constant and can be ascribed to the less efficient convection cooling of the magneto-optic crystal of the Faraday isolator. An isolation decrease by a factor of 10 is experimentally observed in a Faraday isolator that is used in a gravitational wave experiment (Virgo) with a 10 W input laser when going from air to vacuum. A finite element model simulation reproduces with a great accuracy the experimental data measured on Virgo and on a test bench. A first set of measurements of the thermal lensing has been used to characterize the losses of the crystal, which depend on the sample. The isolation factor measured on Virgo confirms the simulation model and the absorption losses of 0.0016 ± 0.0002/cm for the TGG magneto-optic crystal used in the Faraday isolator.}},

Optical components that transmit the laser light will exhibit increased thermal lensing induced by bulk absorption and concomitant changes in the material refractive index, resulting in significant changes in the modal characteristics of the beam. Key interferometer components such as electro-optic modulators and Faraday isolators are particularly at risk, since they possess relatively large absorption coefficients. We present a method for passive correction of thermally induced optical path length (ΔΛ) changes induced by absorption in transmissive optical components. Our method relies on introducing material in the optical path that possesses a negative index temperature derivative, thereby inducing a compensating opposite ΔΛ. We experimentally demonstrate a factor of 10 reduction in higher order spatial mode generation for terbium gallium garnet, a Faraday isolator material.}},

in a temperature gradient which induces depolarization due to both the
temperature dependence of the Verdet constant and the photoelastic
effect of thermal strains. This results in a limitation of the isolation
ratio of Faraday isolators in high average power lasers. Here, we derive
expressions for the isolation ratio as a function of beam power, beam
radius, angle between incident polarization and crystal axis, and
characteristics of the magnetooptical material. The theoretical results
are compared with experiments for a terbium gallium garnet crystal. Our
results allow us to choose the optimal parameters to maximize the
isolation ratio and to compare different materials from this point of
view}},

    abstract = {{We present an up-to-date, comprehensive summary of the rates for all types of compact binary coalescence sources detectable by the initial and advanced versions of the ground-based gravitational-wave detectors LIGO and Virgo. Astrophysical estimates for compact-binary coalescence rates depend on a number of assumptions and unknown model parameters and are still uncertain. The most confident among these estimates are the rate predictions for coalescing binary neutron stars which are based on extrapolations from observed binary pulsars in our galaxy. These yield a likely coalescence rate of 100 Myr −1  per Milky Way Equivalent Galaxy (MWEG), although the rate could plausibly range from 1 Myr −1  MWEG −1  to 1000 Myr −1  MWEG −1  (Kalogera  et al  2004  Astrophys. J.   601  L179; Kalogera  et al  2004  Astrophys. J.   614  L137 (erratum)). We convert coalescence rates into detection rates based on data from the LIGO S5 and Virgo VSR2 science runs and projected sensitivities for our advanced detectors. Using the detector sensitivities derived from these data, we find a likely detection rate of 0.02 per year for Initial LIGO–Virgo interferometers, with a plausible range between 2  ×  10 −4  and 0.2 per year. The likely binary neutron–star detection rate for the Advanced LIGO–Virgo network increases to 40 events per year, with a range between 0.4 and 400 per year.}},

The radiation pressure noise is increased in a high finesse cavity with a small mass mirror. In our experiment a Fabry-Perot Michelson interferometer with a homodyne detection scheme will be built with Fabry-Perot cavities of finesse of 10000 containing suspended mirrors of 23 mg. To observe the radiation pressure noise, the goal sensitivity is set to 1 × 10 -17  [m/ √Hz] at 1 kHz. Then the radiation pressure noise is reduced by adjusting the homodyne phase. To achieve the sensitivity, the other noise sources such as thermal noises, seismic noise and laser frequency noise should be suppressed below 1 × 10 -18  [m/√ Hz] at 1kHz. The whole interferometer is suspended as a double pendulum on double-layer stacks. As a preliminary setup, a Fabry-Perot cavity of finesse of 800 with a suspended mirror of 100 mg was locked.

    abstract = {{Interferometric gravitational wave detectors are designed to detect small perturbations in the relative lengths of their kilometer-scale arms that are induced by passing gravitational radiation. An analysis of the effects of imperfect optical alignment on the strain sensitivity of such an interferometer shows that to achieve maximum strain sensitivity at the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory requires that the angular orientations of the optics be within 10−8 rad rms of the optical axis, and the beam must be kept centered on the mirrors within 1 mm. In addition, fluctuations in the input laser beam direction must be less than 1.5 × 10−14 rad/√Hz in angle and less than 2.8 × 10−10 m/√Hz in transverse displacement for frequencies f > 150 Hz in order that they not produce spurious noise in the gravitational wave readout channel. We show that seismic disturbances limit the use of local reference frames for angular alignment at a level approximately an order of magnitude worse than required. A wave-front sensing scheme that uses the input laser beam as the reference axis is presented that successfully discriminates among all angular degrees of freedom and permits the implementation of a closed-loop servo control to suppress the environmentally driven angular fluctuations sufficiently.}},

As compared with previous LIGO detectors, there will be increased complexity in the optical configuration, improved seismic isolation system and significantly higher power circulating in the arm cavities. In the new detectors, the control of the angular orientation of the mirrors will be particularly challenging. The advanced LIGO (aLIGO) mirrors need to have a residual angular motion of the order of 1 nrad RMS in order to achieve high sensitivity. In the high power regime, the torque induced by radiation pressure effects will be comparable with the restoring torque of the mirror suspension, such that we must think of the opto-mechanical response, instead of just the mechanical response. These modifications have to be considered in order to design the control strategy for keeping the mirrors well aligned. Moreover, to meet the sensitivity target the alignment control noise coupled to the gravitational-wave channel must be well below   at 10 Hz. We developed a model of the alignment sensing and control scheme of aLIGO which takes into account radiation pressure effects and meets the noise target.}},

They are also known to have much higher mean orbital velocities and accelerations than those of other binary pulsars. The system is therefore a good candidate for testing Einstein's theory of general relativity and alternative theories of gravity in the strong-field regime. We report on precision timing observations taken over the 2.5 years since its discovery and present four independent strong-field tests of general relativity. These tests use the theory-independent mass ratio of the two stars. By measuring relativistic corrections to the Keplerian description of the orbital motion, we find that the  ” post-Keplerian” parameter s agrees with the value predicted by general relativity within an uncertainty of 0.05\%, the most precise test yet obtained. We also show that the transverse velocity of the system's center of mass is extremely small. Combined with the system's location near the Sun, this result suggests that future tests of gravitational theories with the double pulsar will supersede the best current solar system tests. It also implies that the second-born pulsar may not have formed through the core collapse of a helium star, as is usually assumed.}},

The use of four-mirrored ring cavity instead of triangular one is expected to mitigate the higher-order mode coupling considerably.

    abstract = {{Two methods of compensation of thermal lensing in high-power terbium gallium garnet (TGG) Faraday isolators have been investigated in detail: compensation by means of an ordinary negative lens and compensation using FK51 Schott glass possessing a negative dn/dT. Key thermooptic constants for TGG crystals and FK51 glass were measured. We find that the contribution of the photoelastic effect to the total thermal lens cannot be neglected for either TGG or FK51. We define a figure of merit for compensating glass and show that for FK51, an ordinary negative lens with an optimal focus is more efficient, but requires physical repositioning of the lens for different laser powers. In contrast, the use of FK51 as a compensating element is passive and works at any laser power, but is less effective than simple telescopic compensation. The efficiency of adaptive compensation can be considerably enhanced by using a compensating glass with figure of merit more than 50, a crystal with natural birefringence or gel.}},

In the modulation regime when the modulation amplitude is small and the predominantly reflection variant is adopted, the ratio of the signal to the shot noise of a photodetector can reach (other conditions being constant) a value of 20–30 dB.

We show that, although the antisymmetric mode of motion of the four arm-cavity mirrors is originally described by a free mass, when the signal-recycling mirror is added to the interferometer, the radiation-pressure force not only disturbs the motion of that  ” free mass” randomly due to quantum fluctuations, but also, and more fundamentally, makes it respond to forces as though it were connected to a spring with a specific optical-mechanical rigidity. This oscillatory response gives rise to a much richer dynamics than previously known for SR interferometers, which enhances the possibilities for reshaping the noise curves and, if thermal noise can be pushed low enough, enables the standard quantum limit to be beaten. We also show the possibility of using servo systems to suppress the instability associated with the optical-mechanical interaction without compromising the sensitivity of the interferometer.}},

Our analysis provides the framework needed to evaluate whether a homodyne or heterodyne readout scheme is more optimal for second generation interferometers from an astrophysical point of view.

We measured shifts of the rotational resonant frequencies of the suspended mirror from 2.0 Hz to 1.0 Hz with the increased circulating power.

@article{Meers1988Recycling,
    abstract = {{Laser interferometers may detect gravitational waves by sensing the strain in space produced by their passage. The resultant change in intensity of an interference fringe must be observable against a background noise due to the statistical fluctuations in the number of detected photons. Optimization of the detector sensitivity thus involves devising an optical system which both maximizes the signal and minimizes the noise. This is attempted in the various arrangements known collectively as light recycling. Here, the performance of these systems is quantitatively assessed. Standard or broadband recycling functions essentially by making efficient use of the available light, but it is shown that it may also be made to further enhance the sensitivity within a narrow bandwidth, becoming tuned recycling. This works, as do all the narrow-band variants, by arranging for both the laser light and a gravitational-wave-induced sideband to be resonant in the optical system. The original narrow-band system, resonant recycling, can also be made broadband; the various sensitivity-bandwidth combinations, together with the tuning properties of such a system, are discussed.Furthermore, a new optical arrangement, dual recycling, is proposed. Its optical layout is an extension of standard recycling and its strength lies in its flexibility. It is shown that, relatively simply, it may be made into either a broadband or a narrow-band system, in each case with the same performance as the best of the other schemes. It may be tuned more efficiently and easily over a wide range of frequencies. Uniquely, optimum performance may be obtained with dual recycling without the requirement that the storage time of the optical elements in each arm of the interferometer be comparable with the period of the gravitational wave. This may allow the operation of delay line interferometers down to much lower gravitational-wave frequency and will provide great operational flexibility. Finally, it is shown that dual recycling, together with resonant recycling, is relatively insensitive to imperfections in the geometrical quality of the optical system. When implemented on interferometers with lengths greater than about a kilometer, recycling should allow the attainment of the sensitivity required in order to observe gravitational waves and open up a new window to the Universe.}},

@article{Weber1960Detection,
    abstract = {{Methods are proposed for measurement of the Riemann tensor and detection of gravitational waves. These make use of the fact that relative motion of mass points, or strains in a crystal, can be produced by second derivatives of the gravitational fields. The strains in a crystal may result in electric polarization in consequence of the piezoelectric effect. Measurement of voltages then enables certain components of the Riemann tensor to be determined. Mathematical analysis of the limitations is given. Arrangements are presented for search for gravitational radiation.The generation of gravitational waves in the laboratory is discussed. New methods are proposed which employ electrically induced stresses in crystals. These give approximately a seventeen-order increase in radiation over a spinning rod of the same length as the crystal. At the same frequency the crystal gives radiation which is about thirty-nine orders greater than that of a spinning rod.}},

B1913+16.  Together with the Keplerian orbital parameters, measurements
of the relativistic periastron advance and a combination of
gravitational redshift and time dilation yield the stellar masses with
high accuracy.  The measured rate of change of orbital period agrees
with that expected from the emission of gravitational radiation,
according to general relativity, to within about 0.2 percent. Systematic
effects depending on the pulsar distance and on poorly known Galactic
constants now dominate the error budget, so tighter bounds will be
difficult to obtain.  Geodetic precession of the pulsar spin axis leads
to secular changes in pulse shape as the pulsar-observer geometry
changes.  This effect makes it possible to model the two-dimensional
structure of the beam.  We find that the beam is elongated in the
latitude direction and appears to be pinched in longitude near its
center.}},

An exact computation of the antenna response is given in a form that is also suitable to provide directly the responses for simplier optical configurations without the power or the signal recycling. Furthermore the response of the antenna for the narrow-band detection mode is also calculated. The results obtained in the FNC gauge at rest with the antenna are consistent with the ones given in the literature that were computed in the transverse traceless gauge at rest with the gravitational radiation.}},

We used a diffractive optic and a mode-cleaner cavity to convert a fundamental LG00 Gaussian beam into an LG33 mode with a purity of 98\%. The ratio between the power of the LG00 mode of our laser and the power of the LG33 transmitted by the cavity was 36\%. By measuring the transmission of our setup using the LG00, we inferred that the conversion efficiency specific to the LG33 mode was 49\%. We illuminated a Michelson interferometer with the LG33 beam and achieved a visibility of 97\%.}},

    abstract = {{We present a search for periodic gravitational waves from the neutron star in the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A. The search coherently analyzes data in a 12 day interval taken from the fifth science run of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory. It searches gravitational-wave frequencies from 100 to 300 Hz and covers a wide range of first and second frequency derivatives appropriate for the age of the remnant and for different spin-down mechanisms. No gravitational-wave signal was detected. Within the range of search frequencies, we set 95\% confidence upper limits of (0.7-1.2) × 10 –24  on the intrinsic gravitational-wave strain, (0.4-4) × 10 –4  on the equatorial ellipticity of the neutron star, and 0.005-0.14 on the amplitude of  r -mode oscillations of the neutron star. These direct upper limits beat indirect limits derived from energy conservation and enter the range of theoretical predictions involving crystalline exotic matter or runaway  r -modes. This paper is also the first gravitational-wave search to present upper limits on the  r -mode amplitude.}},

    abstract = {{We introduce a novel cooling technique capable of approaching the quantum ground state of a kilogram-scale system—an interferometric gravitational wave detector. The detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) operate within a factor of 10 of the standard quantum limit (SQL), providing a displacement sensitivity of 10 −18  m in a 100 Hz band centered on 150 Hz. With a new feedback strategy, we dynamically shift the resonant frequency of a 2.7 kg pendulum mode to lie within this optimal band, where its effective temperature falls as low as 1.4 μK, and its occupation number reaches about 200 quanta. This work shows how the exquisite sensitivity necessary to detect gravitational waves can be made available to probe the validity of quantum mechanics on an enormous mass scale.}},

Wave-front distortion is seen to be a serious problem for interferometers which recycle only the light power. We suggest that the use of dual recycling can confer greater tolerance of distortion, and therefore better gravitational-wave sensitivity, upon an interferometer. This suggestion is backed up with results from an experimental implementation of dual recycling. However, in its simple form, dual recycling only helps significantly when the signal bandwidth is narrowed. We propose a new optical arrangement, dual recycling with a compound mirror, which gives greater tolerance of distortion without restricting the bandwidth. This may improve the sensitivity of future gravitational-wave detectors by a factor as high as 5, while at the same time improving their operational flexibility.}},

Numerical simulations show an increased sensitivity between 125 and 400 Hz, with a maximal improvement of about 80\% around 225 Hz, while the sensitivity above 400 Hz is decreased. Furthermore, our concept is found to give a sensitivity similar to that of a conventional RSE configuration with a signal-recycling mirror of moderate reflectivity. In the near future detuned arm cavities might be a beneficial alternative to RSE, due to the potentially less hardware-intensive implementation of the proposed concept.}},

to detect gravitational waves. The interaction of a gravitational wave
with light in the interferometer is usually explained in terms of the
motion of the ``free'' mirrors that form the interferometer arms. It is
instructive to show that the same result can be obtained by calculating
the propagation of an electromagnetic plane wave between free mirrors in
the curved space-time induced by the gravitational wave. We find that
the plane wave acquires frequency modulation sidebands at the frequency
of the gravitational wave. Such sidebands are equivalent to the
time-dependent phase shift imposed on the plane wave, as obtained in the

    abstract = {{In this article, we present a new gravitational-wave detector based on superconducting magnetic levitation and results of its prototype test. Our detector is composed of the suspended test mass that is rotated by gravitational waves. Gravitational wave signals are readout by monitoring its angular motion. Superconducting magnetic levitation is used for the suspension of the test mass, since it has many advantages, such as zero mechanical loss and resonant frequency around its suspension axis in an ideal situation. For the study of actual performance of such gravitational-wave detector, a prototype detector has been developed. Using the prototype detector, the actual loss factor and resonant frequency are measured as 1.2 × 10−8 Nms/rad and 5 mHz respectively. A detector noise is also evaluated. The current noise level is determined by the magnetic coupling with external magnetic field and mechanical coupling between translation and angular motion. The prototype detector has already one of the lowest noise levels for gravitational waves at 0.1 Hz among current gravitational-wave detectors. We have succeeded at the demonstration of the advantages of our torsion gravitational-wave detector.}},

    abstract = {{We report on the use of a radiation pressure induced restoring force, the optical spring effect, to optically dilute the mechanical damping of a 1\^{A} g suspended mirror, which is then cooled by active feedback (cold damping). Optical dilution relaxes the limit on cooling imposed by mechanical losses, allowing the oscillator mode to reach a minimum temperature of 6.9\^{A} mK, a factor of \^{a}¼40\^{a}000 below the environmental temperature. A further advantage of the optical spring effect is that it can increase the number of oscillations before decoherence by several orders of magnitude. In the present experiment we infer an increase in the dynamical lifetime of the state by a factor of \^{a}¼200.}},

@article{Niebauer1991Nonstationary,

The spectrum of such modulated shot noise, although it is still white, is shown to contain correlations between different frequency components. In addition, the noise is not equally distributed in phase. These effects can deteriorate the shot-noise-limited sensitivity of modulated interferometers. Maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) introduces constraints on both the modulation and demodulation waveforms. The sensitivities obtained with several commonly used modulation schemes are calculated, and new modulation strategies are proposed to realize good SNR. We apply the results to the case of laser interferometer gravitational wave detectors where it is essential to reach a shot-noise-limited sensitivity. By taking into account the additional noise contribution from the modulated shot noise, we reduce the 3-dB discrepancy between the measured sensitivity of the Garching prototype detector and the theoretical shot-noise limit to about 1.5 dB.}},

To determine the beam quality of the coherent test beam, this optical resonator is used to perform a mode decomposition into Hermite-Gaussian modes. For our laser system, a power fraction in the fundamental Gaussian mode of 97.2\%+/-0.2\% was measured. Residual misalignment and mis-mode-matching to the resonator as well as the astigmatism and/or ellipticity of the test beam have been determined. Numerical simulations showed that measurements of the M(2) factor and transversal intensity distribution are not suitable for determining this power fraction. To measure the beam pointing, the fundamental mode of the optical resonator was used as a stable reference. The pointing of the test beam was measured with the differential wave front sensing technique up to Fourier frequencies of 1 kHz with a sensitivity to relative pointing of /epsilon/=1x10(-6)/sqrt[Hz]. Pointing measurements with an alternative method were performed and showed good agreement.}},

The key property of a two-photon device is that it excites pairs of output modes independently. Thus our new formalism deals with two modes at a time; a continuum multimode description can be built by integrating over independently excited pairs of modes. For a pair of modes at frequencies  Ω±ε , we define (i)  quadrature-phase amplitudes,  which are complex-amplitude operators for modulation at frequency  ε  of waves ''cos[Ω(t-x/c)]'' and ''sin[Ω(t-x/c)]'' and (ii)  two-mode squeezed states,  which are the output states of an ideal two-photon device. The quadrature-phase amplitudes and the two-mode squeezed states serve as the building blocks for our formalism; their properties and their physical interpretation are extensively investigated.}},

@article{Caves1981Quantummechanical,
    abstract = {{The interferometers now being developed to detect gravitational waves work by measuring the relative positions of widely separated masses. Two fundamental sources of quantum-mechanical noise determine the sensitivity of such an interferometer: (i) fluctuations in number of output photons (photon-counting error) and (ii) fluctuations in radiation pressure on the masses (radiation-pressure error). Because of the low power of available continuous-wave lasers, the sensitivity of currently planned interferometers will be limited by photon-counting error. This paper presents an analysis of the two types of quantum-mechanical noise, and it proposes a new technique—the "squeezed-state" technique—that allows one to decrease the photon-counting error while increasing the radiation-pressure error, or vice versa. The key requirement of the squeezed-state technique is that the state of the light entering the interferometer's normally unused input port must be not the vacuum, as in a standard interferometer, but rather a "squeezed state"—a state whose uncertainties in the two quadrature phases are unequal. Squeezed states can be generated by a variety of nonlinear optical processes, including degenerate parametric amplification.}},

While this configuration can reduce quantum noise of the detector, it can possibly increase laser frequency noise and intensity noise. The analysis of laser noise in the interferometer with the conventional configuration has been done in several papers, and we shall extend the analysis to the resonant-sideband-extraction configuration with the radiation-pressure effect included.

    abstract = {{We report on the status of the Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and the plans and progress toward Enhanced and Advanced LIGO. The initial LIGO detectors have finished a two-year long data run during which a full year of triple-coincidence data was collected at design sensitivity. Much of this run was also coincident with the data runs of interferometers in Europe, GEO600 and Virgo. The joint analysis of data from this international network of detectors is ongoing. No gravitational wave signals have been detected in analyses completed to date. Currently two of the LIGO detectors are being upgraded to increase their sensitivity in a program called Enhanced LIGO. The Enhanced LIGO detectors will start another roughly one-year long data run with increased sensitivity in 2009. In parallel, construction of Advanced LIGO, a major upgrade to LIGO, has begun. Installation and commissioning of Advanced LIGO hardware at the LIGO sites will commence at the end of the Enhanced LIGO data run in 2011. When fully commissioned, the Advanced LIGO detectors will be ten times as sensitive as the initial LIGO detectors. Advanced LIGO is expected to make several gravitational-wave detections per year.}},

@phdthesis{RobWardThesis,
    abstract = {{There is a worldwide effort to directly detect gravitational radiation. The Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) operates three kilometer- scale interferometric gravitational wave detectors at two sites: two in Hanford, WA and one in Livingston, LA. A significant upgrade, called Advanced LIGO, is planned for these detectors. The core work of this thesis involves using a 40m prototype interferometer on the Caltech campus to study length and sensing and control techniques for Advanced LIGO. The principal results are the development of a lock acquisition protocol for an advanced detector and a comparison of noise couplings between two gravitational wave signal extraction techniques, called RF and DC readout. 
In addition, a search in LIGO data was carried out for broadband, long- duration stochastic gravitational waves emitted from point sources. The results of this search are presented.}},

Part of the transition will be the move from a heterodyne readout to a DC readout scheme.   DC readout performance will be limited by higher order optical modes and control sidebands present at the output port. For optimum performance of DC readout an output mode cleaner (OMC) will clean the output beam of these contributions.   Inclusion of an OMC will introduce new noise sources whose magnitudes needed to be estimated and for which new control systems will be needed.   In this article we set requirements on the performance of these control systems and investigate the simulated performance of different designs.}},

However, the experience in the currently running interferometers reveals several problems connected with a heterodyne readout, of which phase noise of the RF modulation is the most serious one. A homodyne detection scheme (DC-readout), using the highly stabilized and filtered carrier light as a local oscillator for the readout, is considered to be a favourable alternative. Recently a DC-readout scheme has been implemented on the GEO 600 detector. We describe the results of first measurements and give a comparison of the performance achieved with homodyne and heterodyne readout. The implications of the combined use of DC-readout and signal recycling are considered.}},

@article{Forward1978Wideband,
    abstract = {{A wideband laser-interferometer gravitational-radiation antenna was constructed and used to search for gravitational radiation in the frequency band from 1 to 20 kHz. The antenna consisted of a Michelson interferometer with the beamsplitter and retroreflectors attached to masses on soft suspensions that allowed essentially free motion above the suspension frequencies. The strains in the gravitational radiation produce a differential path length change in the two arms of the interferometer which is detected by a pair of balanced photodetectors. The interferometer used a folded-path configuration with an effective length of 8.5 m. The sensitivity of the interferometer was calibrated with signals from a piezoelectric displacement transducer. The strain noise in a 1-Hz bandwidth was less than 0.3 fm/m from 1 to 3 kHz; and less than 0.1 fm/m above 3 kHz; where it was essentially photon-noise limited. (For comparison; the  kT  strain noise in a room-temperature; 2-m long; 1000-kg; elastic solid bar antenna is 0.14 fm/m.) The laser interferometer was operated as a detector for gravitational radiation for 150 h during the nights and weekends from the period 4 October through 3 December 1972. During the same period; bar antennas were operated by the Maryland; Glasgow; and Frascati groups; with 18 events reported by the Frascati group in their single bar; 22 single-bar events and no coincidences reported by the Glasgow group in their two bars; and 28 coincidences reported by the Maryland group between the Argonne bar and the Maryland bar and/or disk antennas. The various bar antenna systems were quite different but in general were sensitive to gravitational-radiation strain spectral components with an amplitude of the order of 0.1 fm/m in a narrow band of frequencies about the resonant frequency of the bar. The wideband interferometer data was analyzed by ear; with the detection sensitivity estimated to be of the order of 1-10 fm/m (depending upon the signature of the signal) for the total of the gravitational-radiation strain spectral components in the band from 1-20 kHz. No significant correlations between the Malibu interferometer output and any of the bar events or coincidences were observed.}},

@article{Drever1983Laser,
    abstract = {{We describe a new and highly effective optical frequency discriminator and laser stabilization system based on signals reflected from a stable Fabry-Perot reference interferometer. High sensitivity for detection of resonance information is achieved by optical heterodyne detection with sidebands produced by rf phase modulation. Physical, optical, and electronic aspects of this discriminator/laser frequency stabilization system are considered in detail. We show that a high-speed domain exists in which the system responds to the phase (rather than frequency) change of the laser; thus with suitable design the servo loop bandwidth is not limited by the cavity response time. We report diagnostic experiments in which a dye laser and gas laser were independently locked to one stable cavity. Because of the precautions employed, the observed sub-100 Hz beat line width shows that the lasers were this stable. Applications of this system of laser stabilization include precision laser spectroscopy and interferometric gravity-wave detectors.}},

@phdthesis{Rakhmanov2000Dynamics,
    abstract = {{This thesis is a study of dynamics of the new laser gravitational-wave detectors.
The analysis in the thesis is developed primarily for LIGO (Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-Wave Observatory) but can be used for other interferometers such
as VIRGO and TAMA. The dynamics of fields in the interferometers are described
in terms of difference equations which take into account the light transit time in
the arm cavities. Solutions for these equations are found in the transient and
steady-state regimes. In particular, a matrix technique is introduced to analyze
the dynamics of fields in a three-mirror coupled cavity. The dynamics of mirrors in
the interferometer are described in terms of nonlinear differential equations with
delays. The mirrors interact with each other through the light circulating in the in-
terferometer. This interaction gives rise to instabilities which lead to violations of
the energy conservation. The instabilities and the associated energy transfers are
studied using both analytical methods and numerical simulations. The dynamics
of interferometers are described in terms of the time-domain difference equations.
Linear transfer functions representing the basic interferometer responses are found
by solving the time-domain equations for different special cases. The main param-
eters for these transfer functions, the poles and zeros, are found as functions of
the mirror reflectivities. Finally, the dynamic response of the interferometers to
gravitational waves is described. The response function includes the forces acting
on the mirrors, the delays in the interferometer arm cavities, and the gravitational
red-shift of light. Optimization of this response suggests a possibility of resonant
detection of gravitational waves which can significantly increase the sensitivity of
the interferometers in a narrow band.}},

@article{Rakhmanov2008Highfrequency,
    abstract = {{Searches for gravitational waves with km-scale laser interferometers often involve the long-wavelength approximation to describe the detector response. The prevailing assumption is that the corrections to the detector response due to its finite size are small and the errors due to the long-wavelength approximation are negligible. Recently, however, Baskaran and Grishchuk (2004 Class. Quantum Grav. 21 4041) found that in a simple Michelson interferometer such errors can be as large as 10\%. For more accurate analysis, these authors proposed to use a linear-frequency correction to the long-wavelength approximation. In this paper we revisit these calculations. We show that the linear-frequency correction is inadequate for certain locations in the sky and therefore accurate analysis requires taking into account the exact formula, commonly derived from the photon round-trip propagation time. Also, we extend the calculations to include the effect of Fabry-Perot resonators in the interferometer arms. Here we show that a simple approximation which combines the long-wavelength Michelson response with the single-pole approximation to the Fabry-Perot transfer function produces rather accurate results. In particular, the difference between the exact and the approximate formulae is at most 2-3\% for those locations in the sky where the detector response is greater than half of its maximum value. We analyse the impact of such errors on detection sensitivity and parameter estimation in searches for periodic gravitational waves emitted by a known pulsar, and in searches for an isotropic stochastic gravitational-wave background. At frequencies up to 1 kHz, the effect of such errors is at most 1-2\%. For higher frequencies, or if more accuracy is required, one should use the exact formula for the detector response.}},

    abstract = {{The coupling of mechanical and optical degrees of freedom via radiation pressure has been a subject of early research in the context of gravitational wave detection. Recent experimental advances have allowed studying for the first time the modifications of mechanical dynamics provided by radiation pressure. This paper reviews the consequences of back-action of light confined in whispering-gallery dielectric microcavities, and presents a unified treatment of its two manifestations: notably the parametric instability (mechanical amplification and oscillation) and radiation pressure back-action cooling. Parametric instability offers a novel ”photonic clock” which is driven purely by the pressure of light. In contrast, radiation pressure cooling can surpass existing cryogenic technologies and offers cooling to phonon occupancies below unity and provides a route towards cavity Quantum Optomechanics.}},

The primary mission of the prototype is to serve as an experimental testbed for upgrades to the LIGO interferometers and for gaining experience with advanced interferometric techniques, including detuned resonant sideband extraction (i.e. signal recycling) and dc readout (optical homodyne detection). The former technique will be employed in Advanced LIGO, and the latter in both Enhanced and Advanced LIGO. Using dc readout for gravitational wave signal extraction has several technical advantages, including reduced laser and oscillator noise couplings as well as reduced shot noise, when compared to the traditional rf readout technique (optical heterodyne detection) currently in use in large-scale ground-based interferometric gravitational wave detectors. The Caltech 40m laboratory is currently prototyping a dc readout system for a fully suspended interferometric gravitational wave detector. The system includes an optical filter cavity at the interferometer's output port, and the associated controls and optics to ensure that the filter cavity is optimally coupled to the interferometer. We present the results of measurements to characterize noise couplings in rf and dc readout using this system.}},

On the other hand, a tilt of the input beam or a mismatch of the beam waist position to cavity waist position couples to these modes in quadrature phase. We also propose a method to measure these coupling coefficients and thereby provide a means to align and mode-match a resonant optical cavity in real time.}},

Starting with basic assumptions about the statistical properties of a stochastic gravity-wave background; we derive expressions for the optimal filter function and signal-to-noise ratio for the cross-correlation of the outputs of two gravity-wave detectors. Sensitivity levels required for detection are then calculated. Issues related to (i) calculating the signal-to-noise ratio for arbitrarily large stochastic backgrounds; (ii) performing the data analysis in the presence of nonstationary detector noise; (iii) combining data from multiple detector pairs to increase the sensitivity of a stochastic background search; (iv) correlating the outputs of 4 or more detectors; and (v) allowing for the possibility of correlated noise in the outputs of two detectors are discussed. We briefly describe a computer simulation that was used to \^{a}experimentally\^{a} verify the theoretical calculations derived in the paper; and which mimics the generation and detection of a simulated stochastic gravity-wave signal in the presence of simulated detector noise. Numerous graphs and tables of numerical data for the five major interferometers (LIGO-WA; LIGO-LA; VIRGO; GEO-600; and TAMA-300) are also given. This information consists of graphs of the noise power spectra; overlap reduction functions; and optimal filter functions; also included are tables of the signal-to-noise ratios and sensitivity levels for cross-correlation measurements between different detector pairs.
