\chapter{Sensing and controlling mirror motion in the radiation pressure eigenbasis} 


\section{Introduction}
In this chapter I show how the angular displacements are sensed and
why control filters implemented in the eigenbasis of radiation
pressure torques is best. 


\section{Sensing}
There are five main subsets of sensor systems for the ASC:
\begin{itemize}
\item OSEMs
\item optical levers (MMT3, RM, BS, ITMX, ITMY, ETMX, ETMY) \vspace{-10pt}
\item camera image (BS)
\item quadrant photodiodes (QPDX, QPDY) \vspace{-10pt}
\item wavefront sensors (WFS1, WFS2, WFS3, WFS4) \vspace{-10pt}
\end{itemize}
Together, these sensors need to provide enough information to derive
adequate control signals for 9 mirrors in both pitch and yaw. Both
absolute motion (AC) and relative motion (DC) need to be
suppressed. The OSEMs and optical levers provide local AC control to
the mirrors. The video camera and the QPDs control the pointing of the
input beam; the video camera works at DC and the QPDs at both DC and
AC. The WFS provide the top level fine tuning of DC and AC control to
the 5 main mirrors.


\subsection{OSEMs}
The most basic level of control is local damping of each suspended
optic provided by the OSEMs. This is always on, even when the
interferometer loses lock. It works by sending current through the
OSEM coils to keep a constant amount of light on the OSEM shadow
sensor.


\subsection{Optical levers}
The optical levers are local to each large optic and provide a record
at all times of pitch and yaw pointing of each mirror with respect to
the ground. The mirrors are velocity-damped only by the optical
levers; they are not controlled at DC. The optical lever is a HeNe
laser beam that reflects off of the mirror and onto a QPD. Both the
laser and QPD are mounted on heavy piers to reduce the seismic noise
contribution to the QPD signal. The optical lever provides a feedback
signal to the mirror's coils to reduce the sensed motion. Each large
optic has its own independent optical lever loop which is almost
always on, even when the interferometer is out of lock. The optical
lever loops provide the second level of controlled stabilization of
the mirrors, after only the local damping.


\subsection{Camera image}
The most primitive sensor is that of the physical video camera.  The
video camera monitors the location of the spot on the beam splitter,
thus serving as a sensor of the pointing of the input beam. The image
of the speckle of light reflected off of the beam splitter (see
Fig. \ref{fig:BCS}) is fed into a labview program which integrates the
intensity of the image to identify the coordinates of the center of
the beam spot. This is compared with a hardcoded desired center
location and a mirror upstream, MMT1 is moved to redirect the input
beam, minimizing the difference between the desired and actual beam
spot location on the BS.

\subsection{QPDs}  
QPDX and QPDY see the small amount light that is transmitted through
the ETMs, providing a monitor of the modal axes of the arm cavities. Together with the , they maintain the alignment of the input . QPDX 


\subsection{WFSs}  
The wavefront sensors provide the most sophisticated form of
measuring angular motion of the mirrors. Their frame of reference is
the fundamental Gaussian mode of the interferometer cavities (x-arm,
y-arm, recycling cavity) as aligned to ???. All of the mirrors
globally follow the pointing of the input beam (via the QPDs) which is
in turn stabilized to the center of the beam splitter (via the BCS) at frequencies well
below the pendulum resonances. The job of the wavefront sensors is to
keep the mirrors aligned to one another up to several Hz within this
hierarchy of alignment. The WFS provide DC and AC control to the
mirror angles. 




\section{Control}
When the gain is really high, comparing the calibrated error and
control signals shows just what the control loop is doing. The error
is the residual and the control is what there would be without the
loop.

error * (1+G) is the motion without the loop, where G is the open loop gain.

\begin{itemize} 
\item optical lever calibration
\item residuals, perhaps for different kinds of seismic
\item compare to mirror motion with no ifo (demonstrate ASC suppression)
\end{itemize}

\section{ASC to DARM noisebudget}
The cut-off frequency of the lowpass filters for the WFS control are
of particular importance in the DARM noisebudget. The lowpass filter
is necessary for suppressing the impression of sensing noise on
suspension control.
