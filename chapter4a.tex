\chapter{Angular Motion of the Interferometer Mirrors}

\textcolor{blue}{write this introduction!}
For light to resonate in the interferometer, the mirrors need to point at one another and remain stationary with respect to this pointing. In practice, however, the mirrors are subject to external disturbances. 

The mode defined by the mirrors needs good overlap with the input beam's mode. (cavity axis aligned in angle and translation with input axis)

The mirrors in LIGO are suspended, both to isolate them from ground motion and to simulate inertial test masses. 


It is necessary to actively align the mirrors for several reasons:
\begin{itemize}
\item find the optimal DC alignment of the interferometer \vspace{-10 pt}
\item suppress any motion that does result from external disturbances \vspace{-10 pt}
\item counteract a high power static instability
\end{itemize}
Furthermore, due to radiation pressure interaction, the system is not even stable at high power.

mirrors are subject to external disturbances, plus they're not stable. we have to do something about it. 

mirrors move around, this is bad, moreover they're not even stable.

While we usually talk about the need to control the lengths, for every length degree of freedom, there are two angular degrees of freedom that need to be sensed and controlled for the same reasons. 

The mirrors are statically unstable and need to be held in place. 

This chapter discusses the causes of mirror angular displacement and the effects of residual mirror motion on the interferometer.




Any torque produces an angular displacement of the mirror as governed by the mirror's torque to angle transfer function.

A consequence is that even when all of the mirrors are perfectly aligned at all frequencies, the simple existence of light in the interferometer makes the arm cavities statically unstable when high enough laser powers are used.

\section{Tolerance for Angular Motion}
\textcolor{blue}{Make this section correct! power fluctations only couple quadratically (bi-linearly) to DARM, but the contrast defect thing is \emph{indistinguishable} from gravitational waves. the A2L should still be emphasized.}
% Unlike DARM where the uncontrolled length displacement is what matters, it's the controlled  motion of the mirrors that matters for angular displacement. Too much residual motion, and both the lever arm effect and power fluctuations create noise in DARM. To prevent angular mirror motion from creating length displacements, the mirrors must not move more than $10^{-8}$ rad rms and the beam spots no more than 1 mm rms, as The residula motion must be held below 

Besides allowing the interferometer to be in a locked state, minimal motion of the mirrors is necessary to achieve the highest possible sensivity to strain. The requirements for how much motion is tolerable stem from two effects of misalignment that directly couple to strain sensitivity: failure to achieve maximum power gain, and angle to length coupling. The misalignment tolerances are dictated by what is necessary to prevent the strain sensitivity of the perfectly aligned interferometer from degrading by more than 0.5\% in the detection band of 40-7000~Hz \cite{Fritschel1997Alignment}.

Because the strain sensitivity is proportional to the power buildup (see Eq. \ref{}), a decrease in circulating power directly results in a decrease of shot-noise-limited DARM. Differing power fluctuations in the two arm cavities results in a changing contrast defect, a difference in the amount of light returning from one arm compared to the other, which increases the shot noise at the AS port. Excessive fluctuations in the power recycling cavity makes for inconsistent signal to noise ratios for the signals that depend on sideband power. To maintain a power buildup within 1\% of maximum, the core optics must have an angular displacement of less than $10^{-8}$ rad rms with respect to the cavity axis \cite{ISCGroup1998ASC}. The derivation of power buildup as a function of mirror angle displacement is found in Appendix \ref{sec:cavitypower}.


\textcolor{blue}{work this paragraph in somewhere}
The idea is that when the axis of rotation of a mirror coincides with the center of the beam, any tilt of the mirror about this axis does not affect the path length of the reflected beam. However, if there is a mismatch between rotation axis and beam location, then the light will pick up a longitudinal phase shift when the mirror is tilted. During a full interferometer lock, this is recorded by DARM.



When the beam is located a distance $x$ away from the center of the mirror, an
angular displacement of the mirror $\theta$ about its center results in a path
length change of the beam
\begin{equation}
\Delta{L} = x * \theta
\end{equation}
which has a direct impact on DARM. Therefore, the alignment specifications must include not only tolerable levels of angular motion, but requirements for the physical centering of the beam spots on the mirrors. As detailed in Ref. \cite{ISCGroup1998ASC}, the beams must be centered on the core optics within 1~mm. At DC, for x ~=~1 mm and $\theta = 10^{-7}$ rad, $\Delta{L} = 10^{-10}$ m which is four orders of magnitude below the DARM rms of $10^{-6}$ m. \textcolor{blue}{Convolve my bsm spectra and residual mirror motion spectra to show example.}




\section{Sources of Angular Mirror Motion}
There is a continuous stream of changing torque inputs to the mirrors that cause them to twist and turn in pitch and in yaw. Some torque inputs exist regardless of the state of the interferometer, while others are a direct consequence of the control systems. The primary torque inputs are introduced here, and further discussion of some of them is found later in the chapter. The list includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item ground motion \vspace{-10pt} 
\item seismic isolation \vspace{-10pt} 
\item coil actuators (length to angle) \vspace{-10pt}
\item noise impression from the angular control system \vspace{-10pt}
\item radiation pressure
\end{itemize}
\textcolor{blue}{say something about seismometer feed-forward signals. say something about imperfect HEPI pos actuation}



\subsection{Ground Motion} 
The most egregious of these torque inputs is ground motion that makes its way through the multiple stages of seismic isolation to the mirror suspensions and thence to the mirrors. Ground motion is the only source of angular motion that is present regardless of the state of interferometer operation. An example of the shape and amount of angular motion experienced by the core optics due to seismic noise during a relatively quiet seismic time is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:seismicMirror}. These spectra include the effect of local velocity damping since the optical levers are always on (see Sec. \ref{sec:suspension}). The rms mirror motion is of the order $10^{-7}$ rad. This is the motion that needs to be controlled interferometrically.

% motion due to seismic noise. Show the effect at a select few different
% times of day, probably for just one mirror. Write this section once I
% see what I have to present.

Proof that this motion indeed originates from the ground can be provided by computing Wiener filters for the seismomter signals to see their coherence with the optical lever error signals. Figures are in appendix \ref{sec:oplev_contributions}





% \subsubsection{Seismic isolation}
% Although the multiple layers of seismic isolation serve to make interferometer operation possible \textcolor{blue}{write something better!}, minor imperfections in their implementation can result in them serving as coupling mechanisms to mirror angle. The path from ground to mirror can be broken into two distinct parts: HEPI + stack position to angle, and suspension position to angle. The seismic tables (HEPI at LLO) are actively actuated upon in position, ie. for the tidal servo. Any position to angle coupling will twist the table. The suspension 


% \subsubsection{Seismometers}
% The seismometers are sensitive to six degrees of freedom: x, y, z, and rotation about x, y, and z. Ideally, they are set up to only measure ground motion in x, y, and z, but the signals may be contaminated by some tilt as well. \textcolor{blue}{???}




\subsection{Coil Actuators} 
\label{sec:L2A}
Imperfections in the behavior of the actuators on the rear of the test masses can convert piston (pure translation) drives into torque. The lengths of the cavities are carefully controlled (that's what we strive to be most sensitive to!) and any imbalances between the four electromagnets on a single mirror will create a coupling from length drive to angle (L2A). This effect is measurable, but is carefully tuned out through selecting appropriate digital gains for each of the coils. Relative gain variation is 10\% of average. The ability to tune the gains perfectly is limited and the residual length to angle coupling is about 1\%. For the typical rms length drive of 1~\micron on a core optic and osems separated by a distance of $\sqrt{2} R$ where $R$ is the radius of the optic, the 1\% L2A coupling results in a $10^{-8}$ radian displacement: \begin{equation} \theta = \frac{0.01 * 10^{-6} \mbox{ m}}{\sqrt{2} * 0.125 \mbox{ m}} \approx 10^{-8} \mbox{ rad}.  \end{equation}

% Maybe include a figure that takes a typical length control spectrum signal to an optic and multiply by the above factors to show spectrum of angular motion induced by 1\% L2A.


\subsection{Noise from Angular Control}
The angular control system, which strives to counteract the above torque inputs to reduce angular motion, introduces angular mirror motion itself. The primary way it contributes noise is through imperfect sensing of the angular displacements. The alignment is also undercontrolled, which ends up allowing the control system to impress input beam motion on the mirrors. These issues are explained in more detail in \ref{sec:ASClimits}.


\subsection{Radiation Pressure} 
\label{sec:rp_intro}
Radiation pressure creates a torque when the beam impinges the mirror
off-center. The force on the mirror due to radiation pressure is
derived from the change in momentum of a photon upon reflection off
the mirror and results in:
\begin{equation}
F_{rp} = \frac{2 P} {c}
\end{equation}
where $P$ is the power of the light reflected by the mirror and $c$ is the
speed of light. Assuming the beam of photons strikes the mirror
perpendicular to its surface, the torque exerted on a mirror due to
radiation pressure is
\begin{equation}
\tau_{rp} = \frac{2 P x} {c}
\label{eq:tau_rp}
\end{equation}
where $x$ is the distance of the beam from the mirror's center of mass. For a 40~kW beam 1~mm off-center, the torque is on the order of $10^{-7}$ Nm, yielding an angular displacement of the order $10^{-7}$ rad as determined by the pendulum torque to angle transfer function (see Section~\ref{sec:pendTF}).

Amongst the various torque inputs, radiation pressure plays a unique role in mirror motion because the torque it exerts depends on the angles of the mirrors. 
%This is a result of the geometric coupling between beam displacements and mirror angles as will be shown in the next chapter. Radiation pressure therefore acts as an angular spring. 
It is best treated not as an external torque, but as a modification to the pendulum torque to angle transfer function. Chapter~\ref{ch:eigenmodes} dedicates a discussion to this matter. In all, radiation pressure shapes the angular dynamics of the mirrors in LIGO and plays an important role in the design of an angular control system.






\section{The Mirror as a Torsion Pendulum}
\label{sec:pendTF}
Understanding exactly how these sources of torque on the mirrors convert to angular motion requires a model of the mirror's torque to angle transfer function.
% In order to design a control system that reduces the angular motion of
% the interferometer mirrors to the levels necessary for stable
% interferometer operation and minimal impact on strain sensitivity, the
% angular response of the mirrors to external torque must be fully
% understood. 
The mirrors in LIGO may be regarded as torsion pendula. Each mirror is
suspended from a single \textcolor{blue}{xx m diameter} wire that
loops around the bottom of the barrel of the mirror as shown in
Fig. \ref{fig:suspension}. Stand-offs glued just above the mirror's
center of mass on both sides of the barrel mark the final point of
contact of the wire with the mirror, and both ends of the wire are
clamped to the top of a suspension cage. The mirror is free to twist
an angle $\theta$ about a horizontal axis passing through its center
of mass to create motion in \emph{pitch} and about a vertical axis
passing through its center of mass to create a motion in \emph{yaw}.

The angular equation of motion of the mirror is governed by the sum of
all torques on the mirror. First, let's consider the most simplistic
scenario where there is only a pendulum restoring torque
$\tau_p=-\kappa_p \theta$, where $\kappa_p$ is the pendulum's
torsional constant. The equation of motion is
\begin{equation}
I \ddot{\theta} + \kappa_p \theta = 0,
\end{equation}
which has a solution of $\theta(t) = \sin({\omega_0 t)}$, where
$\omega_0 = \sqrt{\kappa_p/I}$ is the resonant angular frequency and
$I$ is the mirror's moment of inertia. The pendulum torsional constant
serves to make the mirror oscillate indefinitely about its equilibrium
position upon the slightest of displacements.

\subsection{Torque to Angle Transfer Function of a Pendulum}
\label{sec:t2a}
We are particularly interested in the pendulum's response to an
external torque, such as seismic noise. In order to calculate the
torque to angle transfer function, we must include an external torque
term, $\tau_{ext}$, in the equation of motion:
\begin{equation}
I \ddot{\theta} + \gamma \dot{\theta} + \kappa_p \theta = \tau_{ext}.
\label{eq:eqmotion}
\end{equation}
Here, we have also introduced a velocity damping term, $\gamma$, to
best model reality. Taking the Laplace transform to convert from the
time domain to the frequency domain, we have:
\begin{equation}
I s^2 \Theta + \gamma s \Theta + \kappa_p \Theta = \tau_{ext}
\end{equation}
where $s$ is a complex parameter. The transfer function is then
defined as
\begin{equation}
H(s) := \frac{\Theta(s)}{\tau_{ext}(s)} = \frac{1}{I s^2 + \gamma s + \kappa_p}.
\label{eq:TF}
\end{equation}
We are only interested in examining the transfer function for a pure
sine wave excitation, $e^{i\omega t}$, so we substitute $s=i\omega$ to
get
\begin{equation}
H(\omega) = \frac{1/I}{\omega_0^2  - \omega^2 + i \gamma \omega / I}.
\end{equation}
The resonant frequency of this damped system can be computed by finding the
$\omega$ at which the amplitude of the transfer function, $[I^2
[\omega^2 - \omega_0^2]^2 + \gamma^2 \omega^2]^{-1/2}$, is maximized:
\begin{equation}
\omega_{res} = \sqrt{\omega_0^2 - \frac{\gamma^2}{2I^2}}.
\end{equation}
We note that damping serves to reduce the resonant frequency.

A quantity that is more familiar than $\gamma$ for describing the losses of a system with a real resonance is the quality factor, $Q~:=~\omega_{res}/\mathrm{FWHM}$, where FWHM is the full-width-half-max of the transfer function's amplitude-squared resonance. When the losses are small, $\omega_{res} \approx \omega_0$ and FWHM $\approx \gamma/I$ (see Feynman 23-4). The quality factor is then well approximated by $Q = \sqrt{\kappa_p I}/\gamma$. The transfer function written in terms of $Q$ is \begin{equation} H(\omega) = \frac{1/I}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2 + i \omega \omega_0 / Q}.  \label{eq:TFpendulum} \end{equation}

Figure \ref{fig:pendTF} shows the pendulum torque to angle transfer
function (for pitch) using the parameters of a LIGO core optic. For
external torques applied to the mirror above its resonant frequency,
the mirror acts like a free mass, one that is not held in place by
suspension wires nor subject to damping. For torques applied to the
mirror below its resonant frequency, the mirror's angle is determined
by the inverse of the torsional constant.

  resonant frequency of LIGO core optics in yaw is 0.5~Hz.}

\section{Overview of Interferometer Alignment}
\label{sec:alignment_overview}

There are 8 mirrors whose pitch and yaw angles must be sensed and controlled. The sensing is accomplished by 8 sensors, which fall into three groups:
\begin{itemize}
\item camera image (BS)  \vspace{-10pt}
\item quadrant photodiodes (QPDX, QPDY) \vspace{-10pt}
\item wavefront sensors (WFS1, WFS2, WFS3, WFS4)
\end{itemize}
\textcolor{blue}{Figure \ref{fig:} shows the locations of these sensors.} 
The alignment of these mirrors using these sensors can be simplified by considering the interferometer alignment as happening in two basic units: the input beam and the power recycled Fabry-Perot Michelson. The alignment of the latter is nearly self-contained and can in fact be compacted down to a representative single mirror. The remaining jobs are to align the input beam and this ``single mirror'' to one another and to keep the y-arm perpendicular to the x-arm.

The self-contained alignment of the power recycled Fabry-Perot Michelson is realized through the set of wavefront sensors (WFS\footnote{Pronounced ``woofs''.}), whose principle of operation is described in Section \ref{sec:WFSsensing}. The pitch and yaw motions of the five mirrors in this unit, ETMX, ETMY, ITMX, ITMY, and the PRM, are sensed by the pitch and yaw of five WFS signals, WFS1Q, WFS2I, WFS2Q, WFS3I, and WFS4I, where I and Q denote in-phase and quadrature demodulation, respectively. These WFS look at light at the AS port, at the reflected port, and in the power recycling cavity. Their control signals are used to control the relative motions of these five mirrors up to a couple Hz. 

The MMT-directed input beam and the interferometer ``mirror'' need to be aligned so that the input beam is perfectly reflected upon itself. The input beam follows the interferometer over minute time scales; at higher frequencies the interferometer follows the input beam. The low frequency matching of the input beam pointing to the interferometer ``mirror'' is realized through the pitch and yaw signals of QPDX, a QPD which monitors the position of the light transmitted through the x-arm, and the pitch and yaw signals of a camera that monitors the beam location on the beam splitter. These two alignment sensors adjust the pointing of MMT1 and MMT3 on about minute time scales. An example of the BS camera image is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:BCS}. The higher frequency matching of the input beam pointing to the interferometer is achieved by the reflected port Fabry-Perot Michelson wavefront sensors, up to a couple Hz.

\begin{figure} 
\begin{centering} \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figures/BCSspiricon.pdf} 
\caption[Beam centering servo image of beam splitter]{Image of beam on beam splitter as used in the beam centering servo. The beam appears stretched because the camera's viewing angle is at $45^{\circ}$ with respect to the mirror surface. The color scale is arbitrary, but orange is strong, violet is weak.}
\label{fig:BCS}
\end{centering}
\end{figure}

The one additional step needed for full interferometer alignment is to maintain the relative alignment of the y-arm to the x-arm as the x-arm and input beam together move around. This is accomplished through the pitch and yaw signals of QPDY, the QPD that monitors the light transmitted through the y-arm, which sense how the beam splitter should be pointed. \footnote{QPDX also sends a signal to the BS to compensate for whatever it has MMT3 do.}

All mirror angles are of course interdependent and they must track each other. However, a rough hierarchy of who follows who can be established since ultimately the interferometer is bolted to the ground and necessarily maintains some DC orientation. This orientation comes from QPDX and QPDY, which are physically attached to piers standing on the ground and force the beams transmitted through the ETMs to stay put at a certain location on their sensors. In all, the input beam must make it to those two exact places and the other mirrors are left to line themselves up accordingly. A diagram of this alignment scheme is in Fig. \ref{fig:ASClayout}.

%two input beams, one to the x-arm, one to the y-arm; and the FPM

The QPD servo additionally keeps the BS properly directing light into the y-arm. The wavefront sensing servo maintains the alignment of the FPM mirrors with respect to each other up to several Hz. Each of the seven large optics has its own velocity damping optical lever servo. \textcolor{blue}{Replace this with two drawings, one showing WFS and one showing other sensors. Label and make less cluttered.}}
\label{fig:ASClayout}
\end{centering}
\end{figure}

This alignment process involving the WFS, QPDs, and BS camera relies on the entire interferometer already being locked. It manages the continuous fine-tuning of mirror angles so that maximal power buildup in the interferometer is maintained, and \textcolor{blue}{so that the interferometer does not wander from its linear operating point--define!}. How to achieve the initial alignment of all of the mirrors is an interesting process in itself and is documented in Appendix \ref{sec:initial_alignment}.




\section{The Wavefront Sensing Scheme}
\label{sec:WFSsensing}
Wavefront sensors for angular sensing are the single photodiode equivalent of length sensing. Wavefront sensors are quadrant photodiodes equipped with RF electronics. They rely on the  Pound-Drever-Hall locking scheme to produce error signals.

\section{The Angular Control Servo}
When the interferometer is locked, the optical levers and the wavefront sensors provide simultaneous feedback to the mirror angles. The optical levers provide local damping, and the WFS maintain both the alignment of the power-recycled Michelson with the input beam and the internal alignment of the power-recycled Michelson. The study and characterization of the elements of this angular control system when the laser power is increased is the topic of the remainder of this chapter and the next. Creating a clear picture of the servo without the inclusion of radiation pressure is warranted.

%The broad picture is that we have a 
Fig. \ref{fig:ASCcontrolservo} is a block diagram of the major components to the angular control servo. The torsion-like pendula of the interferometer are subject to external torque which is converted to mirror angle. The interferometer, in turn, turns the mirror angles into TEM10/01 modes at its various ports, and these modes are converted into error signals by the wavefront sensors. The voltages produced by the wavefront sensors are digitized and manipulated by the front-end computers to create control signals that are then \textcolor{blue}{made analog} for actuation on the mirrors. The result of this process is a suppression of the error signal seen by the WFS and therefore a suppression of the physical mirror motions. 

\begin{figure} 
\begin{centering} 
\includegraphics{figures/ASCcontrolservo.pdf} 
\caption[ASC control servo]{ASC control servo. \textcolor{blue}{Highlight analog versus digital.}}
\label{fig:ASCcontrolservo}
\end{centering}
\end{figure}

In Initial LIGO, the wavefront sensor signals were combined via the Input Matrix to form error signals for the differential and common ETM and ITM motions (\textcolor{blue}{explain more}). WFS control filters were designed for this basis and then those control signals were divvied out to appropriate mirrors via the Output Matrix. 



\subsection{Optical lever compensation}
\label{sec:oplevcomp}
One aspect of the control servo that I will explain in detail here is the optical lever compensation.  Each of the large optics has its own optical lever servo that provides velocity damping. Since both the WFS and the optical levers control the mirror motion when the interferometer is locked, we must consider the interaction of the two servos. Whether one views the interaction as the WFS controlling the optical-lever-controlled mirrors, or as the optical levers controlling the WFS-controlled-mirrors is arbitrary. For the purpose of explanation here, I use the former viewpoint.

Figure \ref{fig:OLcomp} zooms in on the portion of the Fig. \ref{fig:ASCcontrolservo} control loop picture that shows the optical lever controlling the pendulum. The torque to angle transfer function of the pendulum is our plant, $P$, the optical lever control is $O$, and the optical lever compensation is shown as $1+OP$. A result of basic control theory is that the optical lever controlled pendulum loop can be represented by its closed loop transfer function:
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{TF_{closed}} = \frac{P}{1+OP}
\end{equation}
as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:OLcomp}~B. 

\begin{figure} 
\begin{centering} 
\subfigure[Zoom of the bottom part of Fig.~\ref{fig:ASCcontrolservo}. $P$ is the pendulum and $O$ is the optical lever control filters.]{\includegraphics{figures/OLcompensation.pdf}} \subfigure[Replacement of the optical lever controlled plant with the closed loop gain representation.]{\includegraphics{figures/OLcompensation2.pdf}} 
\subfigure[Optical lever compensation removes the optical levers from the picture of the pendulum. External torque is still suppressed by the optical lever closed loop gain.]{\includegraphics{figures/OLcompensation3.pdf}} 
\caption[Optical lever compensation scheme]{Optical lever compensation scheme. Subfigures A, B, and C are equivalent.}  
\label{fig:OLcomp} 
\end{centering} 
\end{figure}

One will notice that it is not a coincidence that the optical lever compensation has the same form as the denominator of the closed loop transfer function. Together, they cancel each other out, and all that remains as the plant is the simple pendulum. Including the optical lever compensation in the ASC loop is not necessary, but it is a useful technique for simplifying the design process of the WFS control filters. One need only consider how to control the simple pendulum torque to angle transfer function, rather than the optical-lever controlled pendulum.









\section{Angular Control Limitations}
\label{sec:ASClimits}
The limits for how well we can control the angular motion of the interferometer are governed by how well we are able to sense the angular motion. Several of the wavefront sensors' signals are dark-noise-limited above 20-25~Hz, as seen in Fig. \ref{fig:WFSdarknoise}. Moreover, depending on the power level, WFS1Q may instead be limited by shot noise (see Eq. \ref{eq:shotnoise}). Any control signal derived from frequencies in the sensing noise limited regime will impress the sensor noise on the mirrors. The impression of sensor noise cannot be avoided entirely in the presence of feedback, but can be mitigated by including amongst the control filters a steep cut-off beginning at frequencies where sensor noise dominates. 
%Ultimately, it is the WFS noise floor that determines the best possible achievable suppression. 

\begin{figure} \begin{centering} \subfigure{\includegraphics[width=0.333\textwidth]{figures/wfs1q_darkres.pdf}}\subfigure{\includegraphics[width=0.333\textwidth]{figures/wfs2i_darkres.pdf}}\subfigure{\includegraphics[width=0.333\textwidth]{figures/wfs2q_darkres.pdf}} 
\subfigure{\includegraphics[width=0.333\textwidth]{figures/wfs3i_darkres.pdf}}\subfigure{\includegraphics[width=0.333\textwidth]{figures/wfs4i_darkres.pdf}} 
%\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/ASCsensorsignals.pdf} 
\caption[WFS error signal and dark noise]{WFS dark noise compared to typical error signal. \textcolor{blue}{Include shot noise, too, especially for WFS1.} The excess signal above the dark noise in WFS3I and WFS4I above 20~Hz is likely acoustic noise, although this hypothesis has not been verified. WFS1 and WFS2 are on a floating table in a sound proof chamber, while WFS3 and WFS4 are on a non-seismically isolated table without a sound proof enclosure.}
\label{fig:WFSdarknoise}
\end{centering}
\end{figure}

Besides the sensing noise, there are also sometimes real signals that result in more harm than good when used as feedback. The HAM seismic isolation tables used by the Input Optics (the core optics are suspended from BSC tables) have stack modes at 0.8 to 3~Hz that ring up the MMTs.  At low frequencies, around 1~Hz, some of the WFS signals are dominated by these angular fluctuations of the input beam. The resulting attempt of the mirrors to follow the input beam jitter leads to a magnification of the motion because of the drastically different length scales. Large power fluctuations in both arms and the power recycling cavity ensue, leading to departure from the linear error signal regime and often lock loss. 

Other limitations to the reduction of mirror motion result from the nature of control loops. The cut-off filter, for example, reduces the phase margin of the open loop gain, necessarily pushing down the unity gain frequency (UGF) and therefore the magnitude of suppression at all frequencies below the UGF. A less aggressive cut-off filter, while improving the servo's stability and allowing for higher overall gains, leads to more impression of sensing noise on the optics. Also, if the phase margin of the loop is low, mirror motion will be amplified through gain peaking.

% A final point that should be noted, but is in fact insignificant, is a coupling from angular drive to length that results from the same principle of the length to angle coupling presented in \ref{sec:L2A}. 

% We will show that we don't quite meet all of these requirements and the impression of sensing noise in fact plays a major role in the reduction of DARM sensitivity up to 70 Hz.
