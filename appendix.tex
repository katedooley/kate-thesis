% The Editorial Office Requirements for the Table of Contents cause a
%significant problem in Latex if there is only one Appendix. The
%Appendix is no longer labeled "A" in the TOC but has the word
%"APPENDIX" placed in front of the title of the Appendix. This can be
%done without issue IF nothing needs to be numbered by LaTeX in the
%Appendix. Unfortunately, most of the time something needs to be
%numbered in that single Appendix. For this reason we have included
%the IFTHENELSE switch found in this document and at the beginning of
%AppendixA. We assume that if you have any appendices, that you have
%more than one.  So the default setting is noa = 2 (number of
%appendices = 2). Note: you don't need the actual number of appendices
%here 1 or 2 are the only relevant numbers. You just make sure to
%input the Appendices you do have in this file.  If, however, you DO
%only have one appendix change the line: \setcounter{noa}{2} to
%\setcounter{noa}{1} And comment (or delete) all of the
%input{AppendixB} commands except the first one.  Then open the
%AppendixA.tex file and continue there.

%you can add/substract individual appendices through by using the
% /include{appendix'X'} and creating/deleting the appropriate files
\appendix 
\clearpage
\newcounter{noa} % noa= no. of appendices ... set to 1 for 1 and more otherwise.
\setcounter{noa}{2} % ........................... CHANGE VALUE ONLY HERE
\ifthenelse{\value{noa} = 1}
