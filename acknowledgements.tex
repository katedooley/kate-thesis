And David Feldbaum says I must include a thank you for him because I
made him search the elog for a spiricon BCS picture one too many times
for me.

My neighbor Noah Goldfish for introducing me to Andri Gretarsson who
in turn recommended me to the UF group. Guido and Dave for following
through with recruiting me despite the fact I had already accepted
grad school admission elsewhere! (well outside of the established grad
school admissions timeline), and for supporting my desire to reside at
the site.  }
