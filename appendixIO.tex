\section{Phase Modulation}
\label{sec:phasemodulation}
Phase modulation multiplies carrier light with field
$E_0e^{i\omega t}$ by $e^{i \Gamma \sin{(\Omega t)}}$, where $\Gamma$
is the modulation index and $\Omega$ is the frequency of the phase
modulation. Using the Jacobi-Anger expression,
\begin{equation}
e^{i z \sin{\theta}} = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} J_n(z) e^{i n \theta},
\end{equation}
where $J_n$ are the Bessel functions, we can write the first few terms
(n = 0, 1, -1) of the phase-modulated field:
\begin{equation}
E_{\mathrm{modulated}} = E_0 J_0(\Gamma) e^{i\omega t} + E_0 J_1(\Gamma)
e^{i(\omega + \Omega) t} + E_0 J_{-1}(\Gamma)
e^{i(\omega - \Omega) t} + ...
\end{equation}
We see that both an upper and lower primary sideband are created, with
frequencies $\omega + \Omega$ and $\omega - \Omega$. Phase modulation
does produce an infinite number of sidebands, yet the amplitude of the
Bessel function decays rapidly with higher $|n|$, so only this first
set of sidebands are significant.


\section{Mode Cleaner Pole}
\label{sec:MCpole}
Optical cavities act as low pass filters for intensity variations of
the light sent into them. The model for an intensity noise transfer
function of a cavity is that of a single pole:
\begin{equation}
\frac{E_{after}}{E_{before}} = \frac{1}{1 + s/s_0} = \frac{s_0}{s_0 - s}
\end{equation}
where $s$ is a complex parameter. However, we are interested in only
purely sinusoidal variations in intensity so we let $s$ be purely
imaginary, $s=i\omega$, where $\omega$ is an angular frequency.

We measured the intensity noise transfer function of the Livingston
mode cleaner upon completion of the Enhanced LIGO Input Optics
upgrade. We modulated the intensity of the laser light going into the
MC by injecting a swept-sine excitation in \texttt{L1:PSL-ISS\_EXC}
and measured the power variation of the light in two places: before
and after the mode cleaner. We used a single photodetector (PDA55) in
order to eliminate the PD response, and therefore made the measurement
twice. We ensured there was 1~V~DC on the PD in both locations.

\end{centering}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:mcpole} shows the transfer function data and the fit
(to both magnitude and phase simultaneously). The fit has a pole
frequency of $f_p=4762$ Hz. The $1/e$ ringdown time of the mode
cleaner is therefore $\tau = 1/4\pi f_{MC} = 16.7$ \micro s and the
finesse is $\mathcal{F} = \mathrm{FSR}/2f_p = 1282$.





\section{Gaussian Beam on a Split Photodetector}
\label{app:beamonQPD}
The power per area of a Gaussian beam traveling along the $z$-axis is 
\begin{equation}
p(x,y) = \frac{2 P_0}{\pi w^2} \mbox{exp}\left[\frac{-2x^2}{w^2}\right] \mbox{exp}\left[\frac{-2y^2}{w^2}\right]
\end{equation}
where $w$ is the beam radius at $z$.  This has been normalized such
that $\int_{-\infty}^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty p(x,y) \,dx \,dy =
P_0$. Then, for a beam displaced by $x_0$ from the center of a split
photodetector, the power on the left side is
\begin{eqnarray} 
P_{left} &=& \frac{2 P_0}{\pi w^2} \int_{-\infty}^{x_0} \mbox{exp}\left[\frac{-2x^2}{w^2}\right]  \,dx \int_{-\infty}^\infty \mbox{exp}\left[\frac{-2y^2}{w^2}\right] \,dy \\
&=& \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \frac{P_0}{w} \left[ \int_{-\infty}^{0} \mbox{exp}\left[\frac{-2x^2}{w^2}\right]  \,dx + \int_0^{x_0} \mbox{exp}\left[\frac{-2x^2}{w^2}\right] \,dy \right] \\
&=& \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \frac{P_0}{w} \left[ \frac{w}{2} \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}} + \frac{w}{2} \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}} \int_0^{\sqrt{2} x_0 / w} \mbox{exp}\left[-t^2 \right] \,dt  \right] \\
&=& \frac{P_0}{2} \left[1 + \mbox{erf}\left[ \frac{\sqrt{2} x_0}{w} \right] \right].
\end{eqnarray}
where $\mathrm{erf}(t_0) \equiv \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_0^{t_0}
\mbox{exp}\left[-t^2 \right] \,dt$. The power on the right side is:
\begin{equation}
P_{right} = \frac{P_0}{2} \left[1 - \mbox{erf}\left[ \frac{\sqrt{2} x_0}{w} \right] \right].
\end{equation}
We create a normalized yaw as
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{YAW} = \frac{P_{left} - P_{right}}{P_0} = \mathrm{erf}\left[ \frac{\sqrt{2} x_0}{w} \right].
\end{equation}
Using the Taylor series expansion of the error function, we have a
first order estimate for the relationship between normalized yaw and
beam displacement $x_0$ for a beam of radius $w$:
\begin{equation}
\frac{x_0}{\mathrm{YAW}} \approx \frac{w}{2} \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}.
\end{equation}
The same equation holds true for pitch.




\section{Beam Propagation Formalism}
\label{sec:driftcal}
For the input beam model and for the Input Optics beam drift
calibrations, the ABCD matrix formalism is a useful tool to propagate
a Gaussian beam. I choose to ignore the fact that the MC beam passes
through the substrate of MC3 on its way to the Faraday. I also treat
the beam splitter as a flat mirror and ignore the presence of its
substrate. I use the thickness of the large optic substrates, $t=0.01$
m, and account for index of refraction effects when passing through
optics. Signs of radii of curvature are defined per the front face of
the optic; for example, all main LIGO optics have a positive $R$.

For a beam that strikes a flat interface and exits at a curved
interface (ie. forward-going transmission through RM ):
\begin{equation}
\left\llbracket \begin{array}{c c}
A & B \\
C & D \end{array} \right\rrbracket = 
\left\llbracket \begin{array}{c c}
1 & 0 \\
(n_2-n_1)/Rn_1 & n_2/n_1 \end{array} \right\rrbracket
\left\llbracket \begin{array}{c c}
1 & t \\
0 & 1 \end{array} \right\rrbracket
\left\llbracket \begin{array}{c c}
1 & 0 \\
0 & n_1/n_2 \end{array} \right\rrbracket
\end{equation}

For a beam that strikes a curved interface and exits at a flat
interface (ie. transmission through ETM):
\begin{equation}
\left\llbracket \begin{array}{c c}
A & B \\
C & D \end{array} \right\rrbracket = 
\left\llbracket \begin{array}{c c}
1 & 0 \\
0 & n_2/n_1 \end{array} \right\rrbracket
\left\llbracket \begin{array}{c c}
1 & t \\
0 & 1 \end{array} \right\rrbracket
\left\llbracket \begin{array}{c c}
1 & 0 \\
(n_1-n_2)/-Rn_2 & n_1/n_2 \end{array} \right\rrbracket
\end{equation}

For a beam that strikes a flat interface, travels through the
substrate, reflects off the back of a curved interface, travels
through substrate and exits at the original flat interface (ie. single
bounce off RM):
\begin{equation}
\left\llbracket \begin{array}{c c}
A & B \\
C & D \end{array} \right\rrbracket = 
\left\llbracket \begin{array}{c c}
1 & 0 \\
0 & n_2/n_1 \end{array} \right\rrbracket
\left\llbracket \begin{array}{c c}
1 & t \\
0 & 1 \end{array} \right\rrbracket
\left\llbracket \begin{array}{c c}
1 & 0 \\
2/R & 1 \end{array} \right\rrbracket
\left\llbracket \begin{array}{c c}
1 & t \\
0 & 1 \end{array} \right\rrbracket
\left\llbracket \begin{array}{c c}
1 & 0 \\
0 & n_1/n_2 \end{array} \right\rrbracket
\end{equation}

Finally, for prompt reflection off a curved interface (ie. reflection
off MMTs):
\begin{equation}
\left\llbracket \begin{array}{c c}
A & B \\
C & D \end{array} \right\rrbracket = 
\left\llbracket \begin{array}{c c}
1 & 0 \\
-\frac{2}{R} & 1 \end{array} \right\rrbracket
\end{equation}
and for propagation a distance $d$ through vacuum:
\begin{equation}
\left\llbracket \begin{array}{c c}
A & B \\
C & D \end{array} \right\rrbracket = 
\left\llbracket \begin{array}{c c}
1 & d \\
0 & 1 \end{array} \right\rrbracket.
\end{equation}

For each of these $n_1 = 1$ is the index of refraction of vacuum and
$n_2 = 1.44963$ is the index of refraction of the fused silica used
for the optics. Table \ref{tab:ROCs} shows the radii of curvature of
each of the optics for both sites.

\section{Beam Drift Calibration}
We use the ABCD matrix formulation to convert pitch and yaw data of
WFS3 and WFS4 into a position and angle at the Faraday isolator. The
basic relationship between beam displacement and angle at one location
to displacement and angle at another location is given by:
\begin{equation}
\left \llbracket \begin{array}{c} 
x_1 \\
x^{\prime}_1 \end{array} \right\rrbracket =
\left\llbracket \begin{array}{c c}
A & B \\
C & D \end{array} \right\rrbracket
\left \llbracket \begin{array}{c} 
x_0 \\
x^{\prime}_0 \end{array} \right\rrbracket
\label{eq:abcd}
\end{equation}

For this application, we want to relate the beam positions on the WFS,
$x_{3}$ and $x_{4}$, to the beam position and angle, $x_{FI}$ and
$x^{\prime}_{FI}$, at the Faraday isolator. Using only the top
equation of Eq. \ref{eq:abcd} since the WFS are sensitive to beam
position only and not angle, we can write a new relation
\begin{equation}
\left \llbracket \begin{array}{c} 
x_3 \\
x_4 \end{array} \right\rrbracket =
\left\llbracket \begin{array}{c c}
A_3 & B_3 \\
A_4 & B_4 \end{array} \right\rrbracket
\left \llbracket \begin{array}{c} 
x_{FI} \\
x^{\prime}_{FI} \end{array} \right\rrbracket
\end{equation}
where ${A_3, B_3}$ and ${A_4, B_4}$ are the A and B ABCD matrix
elements for the beam paths from the Faraday isolator to WFS3 and
WFS4, respectively. Taking the inverse and writing $x_3$ and $x_4$ as
a function of the pitch and yaw recorded by the WFS (see Appendix
\ref{app:beamonQPD}), the useful equation is
\begin{equation}
\left \llbracket \begin{array}{c} 
x_{FI} \\
x^{\prime}_{FI} \end{array} \right\rrbracket =
\left\llbracket \begin{array}{c c}
A_3 & B_3 \\
A_4 & B_4 \end{array} \right\rrbracket^{-1}
\left\llbracket \begin{array}{c c}
w_3 & 0 \\
0 & w_4 \end{array} \right\rrbracket
\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}} 
\left \llbracket \begin{array}{c} 
DOF_3 \\
DOF_4 \end{array} \right\rrbracket
\end{equation}
where $w_3$ and $w_4$ are the radii of the beam at each WFS and
DOF can mean PIT or YAW.







\section{Carrier Mode-matching into the Interferometer}
\label{sec:MM}
When a cavity is locked to an input beam, all of the light impinging
the cavity is coupled into it if the cavity is impedance matched and
if the input beam and the cavity are mode-matched. When these
requirements are not met, then light is reflected from the cavity. The
cavity visibility is a quantity that summarizes the compound effect of
these sources of reflected light.\footnote{When there are sidebands,
  as is the case for LIGO, the sidebands are also a source of
  reflected light. We measured that 6\% to 8\% of the power in the
  reflected beam during lock is sideband content, and that the 25~MHz
  sideband visibility is 87\%.} By measuring the interferometer
visibility and by the measuring the impedance mismatch, we can deduce
the carrier mode-matching into the interferometer.


\subsection{Interferometer Visibility}
The visibility is a measure of how much carrier light is reflected
from the locked interferometer compared to how much carrier light is
sent in.  To measure the visibility, we need to know only a few
numbers. We must have a measure of how much light is sent to the
interferometer for normalization purposes and we must have a measure
of the DC reflected power when the interferometer is both locked and
not locked (all light is reflected off of the RM). The visibility is
then given by:
\begin{equation}
\mbox{visibility} = 1 -
\frac{P_{REFL_{locked}}}{P_{REFL_{unlocked}}} \frac{P_{IN_{unlocked}}}{P_{IN_{locked}}}
\end{equation}

We have two measures of how much light is being sent into the
interferometer (a pick-off of the light before it enters the vacuum
and a pick-off of the MC transmitted light) and several of how much
light is reflected. An example showing some of these signals for LLO
is shown in Figure \ref{fig:llomm1630}. The lock stretch ends at $t=5$
min. Note that the amount of reflected light is increasing up to the
end of the lock as the interferometer is losing stability. When lock
is lost, the common mode servo kicks the mode cleaner out of lock too,
and the MC trans power drops to 0. About 15 seconds later the MC
relocks and then the power into it increases. About 15 seconds after
that, at 5.5 minutes, the MC WFS turn on, improving the alignment of
the MC to the input beam and we see another step in the power getting
through the MC. The interferometer is still not locked, so all light
(except for $2.7\%$) is reflected off of the recycling mirror. The
downward spikes in the reflected light trace are the result of
interferometer flashes, instances of all mirrors lining up correctly
to let some light in.

\begin{figure}
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics{figures/llo_mm1630bigger.pdf}
\caption[End of an 8.7 W lock at Livingston on Feb. 23, 2010]{End of
  an 8.7 W lock at Livingston on Feb. 23, 2010. The mode cleaner
  re-locks at 0.5~W about 15~seconds after lock loss and then the
  power is increased to 2~W. Comparison of the minimum intereferometer
  reflected power during lock and the maximum reflected power out of
  lock provides a measure of interferometer mode matching.}
\label{fig:llomm1630}
\end{centering}
\end{figure}

For this particular example, the visibility is 92.1\%.  When evaluated
for a sampling of lock losses throughout the Enhanced LIGO run, the
average visibility is 91.84\% $\pm$ 0.07\%.





\subsection{Impedance Matching}
\label{sec:impedance}
A cavity is impedance matched when the input and output couplers have
the same reflectivity. If there is a difference between the
reflectivities of the two mirrors, the cavity is over- or
under-coupled and light will be reflected. Treating the interferometer
arms as a single mirror that forms a cavity with the RM, we want the
RM transmission to match the transmission of the arms. This must
include all losses in the interferometer such as absorption,
scattering, and ETM transmission. Design estimates resulted in an RM
power transmission of 2.7\%. If losses do not equal 2.7\%, then there is an impedance mismatch and
we will see light at the reflected port. 

The amplitude reflectivity of the interferometer is:
\begin{equation} 
r_{ifo} = \frac{r_{arms}-r_{rm}}{1-r_{rm}r_{arms}}.
\end{equation}
The composite arm cavity amplitude reflectivity is $r_{arms}$ and the
RM amplitude reflectivity is $r_{rm} = \sqrt{0.973}$.  It is not so
simple to know what $r_{arms}$ is in practice. A precise measure of
all losses in the arms would be needed. Therefore, we turn to writing
$r_{arms}$ in terms of a quantity that we can measure, the power
recycled Michelson carrier gain $G_{cr}$:
\begin{equation}
G_{cr} = g_{cr}^2 = \left[\frac{t_{rm}}{1-r_{rm}r_{arms}}\right]^2.
\end{equation}
Experimentally, the recycling gain is measured as
\begin{equation}
G_{cr} = T_{rm} \frac{\mathrm{NPTRX + NPTRY}}{2},
\end{equation}
where NPTRX and NPTRY are channels recording the amount of light
transmitted through the ETMs, normalized such that NPTRX=NPTRY=1
during a single arm lock. For Livingston, $G_{cr} = 39$.

Figure \ref{fig:reflectivity} shows $R_{ifo} = r_{ifo}^2$ as a
function of $G_{cr}$. Curves for a couple different RM reflectivities
are shown to give an idea of how the interferometer reflectivity would
change for minor mis-approximations of the RM reflectivity. 
\begin{figure}
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/R_ifo.pdf}
\caption[Interferometer reflectivity due to impedance
mismatch]{Interferometer reflectivity due to impedance mismatch. The
  percentage of power incident on the RM that is reflected by the
  interferometer is a function of carrier recycling gain and RM
  reflectivity. The carrier recycling gain is 39 for Livingston. The
  recycling mirror power transmission is nominally 2.7\%.}
\label{fig:reflectivity}
\end{centering}
\end{figure}
We find that the impedance mismatch for Livingston is only 0.07\%.



\subsection{Mode-matching}
Any difference between the interferometer visibility and what is
expected from impedance mismatch can be contributed to imperfect mode
matching. For Livingston, the interferometer is nearly perfectly
impedance matched, so all light at the reflected port is due to
imperfect mode matching. Therefore, the LLO mode mismatch during S6
was 8\%.





\section{Overlap Integrals}
A measure of the mode matching can be given by the amount of power
coupled from one mode into another. This is calculated as the square
of the overlap integral of two fields, $\psi_1$ and $\psi_2$, for a
particular z-axis (propagation direction) cross-section:
\begin{equation}
P = \left| \langle \psi \mid \psi^{\prime} \rangle \right|^2 = \left[\int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi^\star(x) \psi^{\prime}(x) \, dx \right]^2
\end{equation}
We are interested in the lowest order Hermite-Gaussian mode:
\begin{equation}
\psi(x,z) = u_0(x,z) = \left[ \frac{2}{\pi w_0^2} \right]^{1/4} \left[
  \frac{q_0}{q(z)} \right]^{1/2} \exp{\left[ \frac{-i k x^2}{2 q(z)}
  \right] }
\end{equation}
which can be rewritten as a function of $x$ and $q$ using
$q_0=i \mbox{Im}(q)$, and $w_0^2 = -2 q_0 i/k$:
\begin{equation}
u_0(x,q) = \left[ \frac{-k \mbox{Im}(q)}{\pi q^2} \right]^{1/4} \exp{\left[ \frac{-i k x^2}{2 q}
  \right] }
\label{eq:u0_xq}
\end{equation}
Eq. (\ref{eq:u0_xq}) is normalized such that $\langle u_0 \mid u_0
\rangle = 1$.

We want to know the square of the overlap integral for two fields
given by different $q$ parameters at one location $z$. First, the
overlap integral:
\begin{align}
\langle q_1 \mid q_2 \rangle &= \int_{-\infty}^\infty u_0(x, q_1) u_0(x, q_2) \, dx \\
 &= \left[ \frac{k^2 \mathrm{Im}(q^\star_1) \mathrm{Im}(q_2)}{\pi^2 q^{\star 2}_1 q^2_2} \right]^{1/4} 
 \int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp{\left[ -\left[ \frac{-i k}{2 q^\star_1} + \frac{i k}{2 q_2} \right]x^2 \right]} \, dx \\
 &= \left[ -\frac{k^2 \mathrm{Im}(q_1) \mathrm{Im}(q_2)}{\pi^2
     q^{\star 2}_1 q^2_2} \right]^{1/4} \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{\left[ \frac{-i k}{2 q^\star_1} + \frac{i k}{2 q_2}
   \right]}} \\
 &= \left[ \mathrm{Im}(q_1) \mathrm{Im}(q_2) \right]^{1/4}
 \sqrt{\frac{2}{q^\star_1 q_2 \left( 1/q_2 - 1/q^\star_1 \right)}} 
\end{align}
Then, the power is given by:
\begin{align}
\left| \langle q_1 \mid q_2 \rangle \right|^2
&= \frac{2 \sqrt{\mathrm{Im}(q_1) \mathrm{Im}(q_2)}}  
{\sqrt{q^\star_1 q_1 q^\star_2 q_2 \left[\frac{1}{q_2} - \frac{1}{q^\star_1} \right]
    \left[\frac{1}{q^\star_2} - \frac{1}{q_1} \right]}} \\
&= \frac{2 \sqrt{\mathrm{Im}(q_1) \mathrm{Im}(q_2)}}{|q_2 - q^\star_1 |} 
\label{eq:power_qs}
\end{align}
Note that Eq. (\ref{eq:power_qs}) simplifies to 1 when $q_1 = q_2$ as
expected and that this whole formulation assumes that the beams are
propagating along the same $z$-axis.
